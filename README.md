### Education
I'm originally from the south suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I did my undergraduate in chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota, with a minor in computer science.

### Work
- Summer 2019: chemical engineering internship at Unilever. Worked on Baby Dove product team to develop novel product formulas
- Summer 2020: software engineering internship at Unilever. Developed data-driven models to predict long-term product outcomes (e.g. shelf stability, product characteristics)
- Fall 2020: engineering co-op at Chart Industries. Developed and prototyped wireless embedded monitoring systems for cryogenic storage products. Studied corrosion risk in existing product fleet
- Spring 2021 - Winter 2022: researcher at Computational Reactive Flow & Energy Lab at the UMN. Developed novel data-driven model to predict combustion characteristics in reduced order space. Optimized models for highly-stiff systems
- February 2022 - July 2024: distributed filesystems engineer at VMware.
- July 2024 - Present: distributed filesystems engineer at Oracle.
