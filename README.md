## Developer Landing Page: Hank (or Henry) Dikeman

‚ú® Hello and welcome! ‚ú®

### A Little About Me üêµ
I'm a senior chemical engineering major graduating December 2021 from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities who happens to love programming! Or am I a programmer who happens to major in chemical engineering? Who knows anymore!<br/><br/>I love playing soccer and lacrosse and I'm always down for a pick-up hockey game

### Where I've worked üíº
I've interned twice at Unilever, first as a process engineer then as a data scientist developing enterprise software. I've also worked as a cryogenics R&D engineering co-op at Chart Industries where I spent a lot of time developing (really cool) wireless embedded systems!<br/><br/>Currently, I work in the [Computational Reactive Flow & Energy Lab](https://crfel.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with Professor Suo Yang, where I work on data-driven methods to accelerate computational physics simulation<br/><br/>If you're interested in any of the above, you can read more at my LinkedIn: [Henry Dikeman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrydikeman/) or email me at dikem003@umn.edu

### What I'm Looking For üî≠
1. **Job Opportunities**: full-time roles, somewhere in the SWE, machine learning engineering, or data science space
2. **Collaboration**: have a cool project idea? Feel free to reach out!
3. **Just To Connect**: I'm always down to talk science/programming!

#### Past Projects ‚òëÔ∏è
- [x] **Biofuel Transesterification Website**: a chemical kinetics website, programmed with R and R Shiny. This allows high-quality forecasting of product ratios and other reaction phenomena in the creation of biofuel using a simple webtool! See the repo [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/TESummerProj2020) or the website itself [here](https://ie-biofuels.shinyapps.io/teapp/)!
- [x] **High-Fidelity Process Simulation Solver**: a process network simulation package, along with an implementation for my senior design project at the UMN! This package uses a Newton iteration as the fixed point solver, along with more sophisticated constrained optimization procedures to solve unit operations and chemical kinetics systems. See the repo [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/Design4501Project2)
- [x] **Satellite Image Farmland Classification Study**: a project undertaken for my data mining class, classifying farmland images according to satellite imagery! See the repo (and the report) [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/DataMining5523)
- [x] **Alarm Clock Embedded Software**: a cute and fun Christmas present, a simple alarm clock program with two settable alarms, customizable light settings, and a pretty annoying alarm noise! See the repo [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/AlarmClock)

#### Current Projects üîú
- [ ] **Data-driven Reactive Flow Modeling @ CRFEL**: Oops, can't say too much about this yet! (pending publication) This is part of my (continuing) work at CRFEL using machine learning forecasting and dimensionality reduction methodologies to accelerate high-fidelity combustion modeling! You can read more about our group [here](https://crfel.umn.edu)!
- [ ] **Thirst**: a fun little video game project I'm working on (who's never wondered what it'd be like to be a thirsty cactus?). See the progress [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/ThirstV1)
- [ ] **Intelligent Weather Prediction Website**: a machine learning-driven weather prediction system, with a Flask front-end, permitting performant weather forecasting without the overhead of traditional computational weather modeling. See my progress [here](https://github.com/hankdikeman/WeatherPred)!
